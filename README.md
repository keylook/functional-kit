# functional-kit
This is a small but handy library that extends `UIKit` in a functional manner.
Inspired by `SwiftUI` and declarative paradigm.

Currently supported `UIKit` Extensions:
`UIView`, `UILabel`

Example usage for `UILabel`
```swift
let label = UILabel()
  .withTextColor(.black)
  .withFont(.systemFontOfSize(14))
  .withText("My Label")
  .withTextAlignment(.center)
```

# installation
Drop `sources` folder in your project. 

This library is work in progress.
